  abstract = {Traffic flow prediction has various applications such as in traffic systems and autonomous driving. Road conditions have become increasingly complex, and this, in turn, has increased the demand for effective traffic volume predictions. Statistical models and conventional machine-learning models have been employed for this purpose more recently, deep learning has been widely used. However, most deep learning-based models require data additional to traffic information, such as information on adjacent roads or road weather conditions. Therefore, the effectiveness of these models is typically restricted to certain roads. Even if such information were available, there is a possibility of bias toward a specific road. To overcome this limitation, based on the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), we propose trafficBERT, a model that is suitable for use on various roads because it is pre-trained with large-scale traffic data. Our model captures time-series information by employing multi-head self-attention in place of the commonly used recurrent neural network. In addition, the autocorrelation between the states before and after each time step is determined more efficiently via factorized embedding parameterization. Our results indicate that trafficBERT outperforms models trained using data for specific roads, as well as commonly used statistical and deep learning models, such as Stacked Autoencoder, and models based on long short-term memory, in terms of accuracy.}

%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
